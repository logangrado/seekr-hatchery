# Task: host-path-mounts

**Status**: complete
**Branch**: hatchery/host-path-mounts
**Created**: 2026-06-04 15:53

## Objective

Make the sandbox indistinguishable from a native run as far as absolute
paths are concerned: mount the host repo / worktree / cwd at its own host
path inside the container, instead of at a fixed `/repo` or `/workspace`.
The container's WORKDIR then equals the host CWD, and any tool that keys
state off `pwd` — agent per-project directories, lockfiles, generated
artifacts, symlink targets — sees the same absolute paths whether the
session is sandboxed or native.

The motivating symptom was an agent's per-project state directory
fragmenting into one entry per worktree (because every sandbox worktree
had a different container CWD), preventing memory and history from
persisting across tasks on the same repo. Under host-path mirroring, the
per-project directory matches what a native run would write and the
agent's own per-repo consolidation (when it has one) does the right
thing automatically. The fix is general, though — it benefits any tool
with path-keyed state and removes a class of "paths inside the sandbox
don't match the host" footguns (symlinks across repos, absolute paths in
lockfiles, etc.).

## Context

Two solutions were considered:

1. **Compute the agent's project slug ourselves** and inject it via the
   agent's own settings (some agents expose a knob for this). Surgical,
   but per-agent — not every backend has an equivalent — and depends on
   each agent's internal slug rule, which can drift.

2. **Mount container paths at host paths.** Make the sandbox
   indistinguishable from a native run as far as paths are concerned.
   Bigger change but covers everything path-keyed, now and in the
   future. Agents' home-directory subdirs are already bind-mounted into
   the container (so writes from inside hit the host), so once the
   container CWD equals the host CWD, all per-project state lands where
   a native run would write it.

Picked option 2: the requirement is "memories / per-project state must
function exactly the same as if we never sandboxed" — option 1 only
handles one specific agent.

## Summary

The hardcoded container paths `CONTAINER_REPO_ROOT = "/repo"`,
`/workspace`, and `CONTAINER_INCLUDES_ROOT = "/includes"` were all
dropped. Worktree mode now mounts the worktree at
`str(meta.worktree_path)` and lays `.git` / sentinel mounts at
`str(meta.repo_path)/.git/...`. No-worktree mode mounts cwd at
`str(meta.worktree_path)`. The container WORKDIR is the host worktree
path (or host cwd, no-worktree). `launch_sandbox_shell` mounts the repo
at its host path. Includes mount at their host paths too, with the same
layered structure for git-repo includes (no basename uniquing, no
include-side `.git` pointer rewrite).

Because container paths equal host paths, the worktree's existing `.git`
pointer file (`gitdir: <host_repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>`) already
resolves correctly inside the container — the previous rewrite-and-shadow
machinery (per-session `git_ptr` file plus a bind-mount over the worktree's
`.git`) was removed for the primary worktree.

The `follow_symlinks` walker (`_construct_symlink_mounts`) was simplified
along the same lines. Previously it rejected two link shapes that couldn't
survive the host→container path remap (absolute links into the scan_root,
relative links escaping it). Under host-path mirroring there is no remap,
so both classes now Just Work: absolute internal links are covered by the
scan_root mount, and relative external links resolve to the same absolute
path on both sides — emit a `target:target` mount and they work like
absolute external links did before. The walker collapses to "if target is
outside scan_root and outside the system blocklist, mount it; else skip."

**Key files changed:**
- `src/seekr_hatchery/constants.py` — dropped `CONTAINER_REPO_ROOT`.
- `src/seekr_hatchery/docker.py` — `launch_context`, `build_mounts`
  (both branches), `run_session`, `launch_sandbox_shell` derive paths
  from `meta.repo_path` / `meta.worktree_path` / `repo`. Added
  `_check_host_path_safe_for_mount()` collision guard that rejects host
  paths colliding with critical container paths (`/usr`, `/etc`,
  `CONTAINER_HOME`, etc.).
- `src/seekr_hatchery/sessions.py` — `sandbox_context()` emits host
  paths in the system prompt; the docker-worktree branch tells the
  agent to use `git show main:path` since the RO main-branch file view
  is gone.
- `src/seekr_hatchery/resources/Dockerfile.template` — dropped
  `WORKDIR /repo` (the container runtime sets WORKDIR via `-w` at run
  time using the host path).
- `src/seekr_hatchery/utils.py` — dropped `unique_basename` (no longer
  has any callers; host paths are inherently unique).
- Tests: `test_pure.py`, `test_sandbox.py`, `test_session_io.py`,
  `test_docker.py` updated to assert against fixture host paths instead
  of hardcoded `/repo`, `/workspace`, or `/includes/<basename>`.

**Tradeoff (call out for future agents):** the RO main-branch file view
that used to exist at `/repo` is gone. The worktree mount now overlays
the parent repo path, so files like `cat <host_repo>/src/foo.py` show
the *worktree branch's* version, not main's. Use `git show main:src/foo.py`
or `git diff main...` instead. `.git/objects` is mounted RW so git
operations work fully.

**Migration note:** existing per-CWD directories under agents' home-state
dirs (anything named after `-repo*` etc.) are not cleaned up
automatically. They're harmless leftovers; the user can `rm -rf` them
after switching over. In-flight sessions started before this change end
up with their session log at the old container-path-derived location;
they're still readable but won't be auto-discovered after the switch.

**Latent bug fixed as a side effect:** under the old scheme, an absolute
symlink inside the primary worktree pointing into an include's host path
would dangle inside the container — the include lived at
`/includes/<basename>`, not at its host path, so the symlink's stored
host path didn't resolve. The symlink walker's "already-covered-by-an-
existing-mount" filter would skip it (the host path was in the existing
mount sources) but the host path it skipped wasn't actually present
inside the container. With includes at host paths, the symlink resolves
directly and the filter correctly identifies it as covered.

**Things to be aware of when modifying this area:**
- The `_git_worktree_mounts` helper takes `container_root` as a string;
  pass `str(repo)` for any repo (primary or included). Container paths
  always mirror host paths now.
- Neither the primary worktree's nor any include worktree's `.git`
  pointer is rewritten. If you ever change the container path away from
  the host path (e.g., reintroduce a fixed `/repo` or `/includes`),
  you'll need to bring back the pointer rewrite + shadow-mount that
  used to live in `run_session` / `build_mounts` / `_docker_mounts_includes`.
- The collision guard rejects any host path (repo, worktree, or
  include) that resolves to the container blocklist (`/`, `/usr`,
  `/etc`, `CONTAINER_HOME`, ...). Subpaths under `/home/hatchery/...`
  are fine — they just add a subdir to the container's home.
