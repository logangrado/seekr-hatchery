"""Cross-module constants shared by sessions, docker, git, and cli.

This is a deliberate leaf module: it imports nothing from the project, so
any other module can import from here without creating a cycle. Anything
that ends up referenced from more than one module belongs here; anything
referenced only from inside its home module should stay there (and be
prefixed ``_`` to mark it private).
