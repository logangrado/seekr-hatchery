"""Stdlib PTY proxy that interposes a chance to inspect TTY bytes.

``docker._run_container`` wraps the interactive ``docker run -it ...``
invocation in :func:`run_with_pty` so that ``clipboard_image``'s OSC 5522
paste interceptor can see and react to bytes flowing between the user's
terminal and the agent inside the container.

The protocol layer is intentionally *not* in this module — this is the
plumbing:

  user terminal               (writes from stdout reach the terminal)
   stdin ──▶ run_with_pty ──▶ master_fd ──▶ child
   stdout ◀──────────────────── master_fd ◀── child

Anything that wants to interpose itself on the stream implements the
:class:`PasteInputSink` protocol; this module reads, dispatches, writes.

Stdlib only.  No threads — a single ``select`` loop drives both fds.
